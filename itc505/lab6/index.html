      <h2>Holi Grail Layout</h2>
      <p>A web design pattern known as the "Holy Grail" layout uses CSS to address a common layout problem. It has a three-column layout with two sidebars on either side of the main content section in the middle column. A header sits atop this arrangement, while a footer serves as its anchor. The "Holy Grail" design is so named because it effectively addresses multiple layout issues: it permits the center content area to resize fluidly, it keeps both sidebars at the same height regardless of the length of content, and it makes sure the layout changes smoothly between devices and screen sizes.</p>

        <p>ADDENDUM : The webpage's visual style and structure are established by the CSS styling section, which also
      emphasizes how the Holy Grail layout is applied through certain styling decisions. Below is a summary of the
      justification: Resetting the margin and padding leaves the and elements with no default spacing, making room for
      bespoke design. This is a critical step in ensuring consistent layout behavior amongst browsers. Font Style In
      order to create a unified and visually appealing design, the CSS defines a font style for the whole page. The font
      selection affects the webpage's readability and general user experience. The CSS Grid is used to build the central
      component of the Holy Grail layout. A three-column layout with well defined sections is produced by styling
      the.container class (sidebar, content, advertisement). This structure is necessary to ensure that the layout
      adjusts to different screen sizes and devices and effectively arranges the webpage's primary elements.The header,
      sidebar, text, advertisement, and footer of a webpage are all given different styles. These styles use extra
      attributes like font weight and size for readability and emphasis, padding for spacing inside each part, and
      background colors to visually separate various areas. The sidebar and advertisement sections flank the primary
      content, adding to the overall balance and functionality of the layout, while the header and footer are stylized
      to stand out as the webpage's top and bottom borders. To summarize, the explanation of CSS styling describes how
      different styles are applied to the webpage in order to structure it, apply the Holy Grail layout, and make sure
      that the design is responsive and consistent. This strategy improves the website's usability and visual appeal.
